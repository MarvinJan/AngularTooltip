<h2>Tooltip created based on the task provided below</h2>
<p>
  Create a single page Angular 4+ app with simple routing that has one
  state/view. In it, place two buttons that when clicked, show a tooltip above
  the button with some text in it. When button A is clicked, if button Bâ€™s
  tooltip is open it should close and vice versa - only one tooltip should be
  visible at a time. Either tooltip should close when clicked anywhere outside
  of it, but remain open if clicked inside. Either tooltip should close when ESC
  key is pressed.

  a simple npm command.
